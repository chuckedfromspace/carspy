abstract = {High-resolution coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy spectra of the N2Q branch at 294 K have been obtained at 1, 5, and 10 atm. Even at 1-atm pressure, disagreements with spectra calculated using the isolated line approximation were observed, indicating the importance of collisional narrowing effects in describing these spectra. A method of using the full G-matrix approach for the calculation of these spectra that is both exact and computationally efficient (requiring only one matrix diagonalization and inversion per spectrum) is discussed. Excellent agreement with experimental data is obtained using this method and a simple exponential gap model for the off-diagonal G-matrix elements.},

year = {1982},
abstract = {The expression for the intensity in coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) was derived for scanning CARS by taking into account the linewidths and phase relation of the two laser beams, and simulation procedures suited for practical applications were developed. The CARS spectra of p-xylene and N2 gas were observed, and the results were compared with the simulation curves based on two extreme cases of the statistical property of the laser source. It was shown that the effect of laser linewidth becomes remarkable when the Raman linewidth is comparable to or smaller than the laser linewidth, and that the degree of coherence among the frequency components within the laser linewidth is an important factor in determining the spectral profile.},

abstract = {The standard approach for including laser line-shape effects in calculated coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectra is shown to be incorrect. The correct approach involves extra terms that become important if the laser linewidth is larger than the Raman linewidths. The standard approach can lead to errors in measurements of concentration or nonresonant susceptibility. A closed-form solution for the special case of Lorentzian laser line shapes is presented. Measurements using broadband and narrow-band lasers support the modified theory but are inconsistent with the standard theory.},

Temperatures were obtained from analysis of background-free nitrogen Q- and O-branch spectra.

Excellent agreement was obtained in regions of relatively constant temperature, whereas improved CARS spatial resolution was required to obtain agreement near steep temperature gradients.},
